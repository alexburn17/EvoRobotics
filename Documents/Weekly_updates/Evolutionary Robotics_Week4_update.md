#### Does robot joint an limb morphology affect evolutionary response to the same distance based fitness function?

#### Time Line:

3) Work on the hillclimber algorithm.

This week I worked on connecting up the ANNs and got the genetic algorithm up and running. I opted to use the genetic algorithm instead of switching back to the parallel hillclimber. The resultant robots have behaved as expected and since beginning the class, I haven't seen an evolved controller do as well. The fitness function is simply the distance from the light sensor as it heads towards the light emitting block. I think I will leave the function simple as I want to control distance and direction while allowing evolutionary freedom for all robot morphologies to better understand the rate of evolution on these different robots.
