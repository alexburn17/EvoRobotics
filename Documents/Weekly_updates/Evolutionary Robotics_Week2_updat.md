## Evolutionary Robotics Final Project

P. Alexander Burnham

#### Does robot joint an limb morphology affect evolutionary response to the same distance based fitness function?

#### Time Line:

1) Create robots one and two that are single jointed.

This week I created two robots that only have **active** joints upon which evolution will act at the body. The first robot has joints that move along the horizontal plane like a lizard (n3=-1) and the second uses joint normals that move about the y axis like oars on a trireme (n1=-1). I decided to implement a six legged robot for this experiment and put legs 3 on a side. I also started a github repo for this project to keep an organized, updatable backup of these files.
