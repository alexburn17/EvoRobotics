## Evolutionary Robotics Final Project

#### Does robot joint an limb morphology affect evolutionary response to the same distance based fitness function?

#### Time Line:

2) Create robots three and four that are double jointed.

This week I created two robots that have a total of 12 motorized joints upon which evolution will act at the body. The third robot has joints that move along the horizontal plane like a lizard (n3=-1) at the body and the forth uses joint normals that move about the y axis like oars on a trireme (n1=-1). In addition, and in contrast to robots one and two, both new robots have active joints at the knees capable of adduction and abduction from the body, totaling in 12 active joints per robot.
